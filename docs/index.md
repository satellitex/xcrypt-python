# Xcrypt-Python

## Overview

Xcrypt-Python is a Python-based job scheduling and management system. It allows users to define, schedule, and manage jobs using a simple configuration file. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

## Features

- **Job Management**: Define and manage jobs using a configuration file.
- **Scheduling**: Schedule jobs to run at specific times or intervals.
- **CLI Interface**: Interact with the system using a command-line interface.
- **Logging**: Built-in logging for monitoring job execution.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the system with custom job types and schedulers.
