# Architecture

## Overview

Xcrypt-Python is designed to be a flexible and extensible job scheduling and management system. The system is built using Python and leverages several libraries to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Components

### 1. **Job Class (`job.py`)**
The `Job` class is responsible for creating and managing individual jobs. Each job has a unique ID, name, and associated data. The class provides methods for scheduling and executing jobs.

### 2. **JobScheduler Class (`scheduler.py`)**
The `JobScheduler` class is responsible for managing the scheduling and execution of jobs. It maintains a list of jobs and provides methods for adding, removing, and executing jobs.

### 3. **Configuration Management (`config.py`)**
The configuration management component is responsible for reading and writing configuration files. It uses the `pyyaml` library to handle YAML files, allowing users to easily manage their configuration settings.

### 4. **CLI Interface (`cli.py`)**
The CLI interface provides a command-line interface for interacting with the system. It uses the `Click` library to define commands and handle user input. The CLI allows users to start, stop, and check the status of jobs.

### 5. **Utility Functions (`utils.py`)**
The utility functions provide common functionality that is used throughout the system. This includes logging, error handling, and other helper functions.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Modularity**
The system is designed to be modular, with each component responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This makes it easy to extend and maintain the system.

### 2. **Extensibility**
The system is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add new features and functionality as needed. This is achieved through the use of well-defined interfaces and a flexible architecture.

### 3. **Testability**
The system is designed to be testable, with comprehensive unit tests provided for each component. This ensures that the system works as expected and makes it easy to identify and fix issues.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.8**: The system is built using Python 3.8.
- **Click**: Used for the CLI interface.
- **PyYAML**: Used for configuration management.
- **pytest**: Used for unit testing.
- **rich**: Used for CLI color output.
- **mypy**: Used for type checking.
- **black**: Used for code formatting.

## Conclusion

Xcrypt-Python is a powerful and flexible job scheduling and management system. Its modular and extensible design makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, and its comprehensive testing ensures that it works as expected. By leveraging popular Python libraries, the system provides a robust and user-friendly experience.
