Here is your equivalent Xcrypt Python code:

```
from xcrypt_python.lib import Xcrypt

template = {
    'id': 'jobsingle',
    'exe0': 'bin/fib-file dat/num40 jobsingle_out',
    'JS_cpu': 1,
    'JS_node': 1,
    'JS_limit_time': 300,
    'before': lambda self: print(f"Submitting {self['id']}"),
    'after': lambda self: print(f"{self['id']} finished")
}

@Xcrypt
def prepare_submit_sync(template):
    jobs = []
    # Here, assuming there's some function "prepare_submit_sync" in base code
    # that encapsulates the logic needed to convert %template into @jobs
    # in Perl.
    # Unfortunately, the Perl code provided doesn't show what that logic is.
    # So I'm leaving this function empty, 
    # but in a real-world conversion we'd fill it with the equivalent Python code.
    return jobs

jobs = prepare_submit_sync(template)
```

Please note that due to the nature of the example, I have to make several assumptions in the Python code assuming that your `xcrypt_python.lib` module has an Xcrypt decorator which allows for such functionality.

Because we can't directly translate Perl's subroutines in hashes to Python's lambda in dictionaries, the 'before' and 'after' keys in the dictionary are made as lambdas. Also, the 'prepare_submit_sync' function Is thought to be part of the Perl base that seems omitted in the code given and hence is included in the decorated Python function.
