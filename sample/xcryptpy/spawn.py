The conversion of the Xcrypt code into Python code is not straightforward due to the fact that Perl and Python have fundamentally different paradigms and capabilities. 

The Perl module `return_transmission`, for instance, doesn't have a Python equivalent, so we cannot directly translate its functionality into Python.

Similarly, the `spawn{}` syntax has no direct equivalent in Python. Python's threading and multiprocessing modules use different syntax and methods to achieve similar functionality. The Perl function `spawn`, `spawn_prepare`, and `spawn_sync` cannot be directly converted into Python equivalent functions, especially when Perl's these functions are part of a third-party library.

For the record, here's a rudimentary and nonfunctional direct translation of the Perl code, ignoring the tricky details and focusing on the conversion of Perl's syntax into Python's:

```python
from xcrypt_python.lib import Xcrypt

@Xcrypt
def sample_code():
    transfer_variable = ['$i']
    for i in range(10, 21):
        j = spawn(i)  # Not a valid Python code, as the spawn functions are not implemented
        print(f'Spawned {j["id"]}\n')
    sync()

    jobs = []
    for i in range(10, 21):
        j = spawn_prepare(i)  # Not a valid Python code, as the spawn functions are not implemented
        print(f'Prepared {j["id"]}\n')
        jobs.append(j)
        
    submit_sync(jobs)

    for i in range(10, 21):
        j = spawn_sync(i)  # Not a valid Python code, as the spawn functions are not implemented
        print(f'Completed {j["id"]}\n')
        jobs.append(j)
```

We emphasize that this code doesn't do what the original Perl code does and won't even run because there's no valid Python functions `spawn`, `sync`, `spawn_prepare`, `submit_sync`, and `spawn_sync`.

Porting this code from Perl to Python would require a complete rewrite using the native Python equivalents for these functions. This rewrite should be done by developers who are deeply familiar with the implementation details and the problem that the original Perl code solves.
