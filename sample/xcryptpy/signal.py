Python Code:

```python
from xcrypt_python.lib import Xcrypt

# A sample of user defined signal handler.
# Push CTRL+C during the execution of this script to try this functionality.

@Xcrypt
def sigint_handler():
    print("User's SIGINT handler is called.")

template = {
    'id': 'jobsig',
    # 10 jobs that are characterized by (30,0), (30,1), ..., (30,4), (40,0), ...,(40,4)
    'RANGE0': [30,40],      
    'RANGE1': list(range(0, 5)),
    # All the jobs have parameter 'exe0' whose value is './bin/fib'
    'exe0': './bin/fib',
    # For parameter whose value is different for each job:
    # * Parameter name is postfixed by '@'
    # * Parameter value is defined as function that returns a parameter value
    # In the function, VALUE[i] can be used to refer to the assigned value
    # from the RANGE[i], and self can be used to refer to the job object.
    'arg0_0@': lambda VALUE: VALUE[0]+VALUE[1],
    'arg0_1@': lambda self: "> out_{}".format(self['id']),
    # Executed asynchronously before submitting a job
    'before': lambda self: print("Submitting {}".format(self['id'])),
    # Executed asynchronously after the job is done
    'after': lambda self: print("{} finished".format(self['id'])) 
    }
Xcrypt.prepare_submit_sync(template)
```

Please ensure that you have the required `xcrypt_python` library installed and configured correctly in your Python environment. Also, please adapt the `Xcrypt` interface to match your actual library if the name in the task is illustrative. This translated code assumes that the Xcrypt library for Python provides similar functionality and interface as the PERL version.
